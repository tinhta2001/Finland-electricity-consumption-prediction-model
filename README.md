# Finland-electricity-consumption-prediction-model

- Electricity demand-along with prices-has become a regular discussion point in the 
media. Electricity companies must accurately forecast demand to act judiciously on 
the wholesale market as part of their daily operations. In this assignment, we will 
forecast the total electricity demand in Finland, as measured by the network operator 
Fingrid. 

- The data on MyCourses will be updated with new information as it becomes available. 
Thus, when you are required to make a forecast on day 𝑵 for the load on day 𝑵+𝟏, you 
will have data available for the Finland electricity load up to day 𝑵−𝟏; FMI weather 
data up to day 𝑵−𝟏; and weather forecast information published on day 𝑵 for the 
weather on day 𝑵+𝟏.

# Project requirements: 

In your forecast, you need to give your estimate of the mean of the logarithm (natural 
logarithm, to base e) of the following day’s consumption, and the standard deviation for 
this number.  The forecast will be scored against actual demand.  We will evaluate both 
the point forecast and the distribution using the log scoring method discussed in 
Lecture 4, where the mean and standard deviation you provide serve to define a normal 
distribution for the value of log load (using log to base e).
